the compiler defines a built in "module" called `intrinsics`.
it contains compile-time information and compile-time utilities.

intrinsics::arch        the target architecture.
    enum {aphelion = 0,}

intrinsics::system      the target OS or environment.
    enum {freestanding = 0,}

intrinsics::product     the type of file created by the compiler.
    enum {assembly = 0,}

intrinsics::assert      checks an expression at compile-time for truth, like C's static_assert.
    fn (cond: bool)

intrinsics::compiler    compiler ID as a string. for the official compiler, this is "mars".
    []let u8

intrinsics::stringeq    compile-time string equality. only works on compile-time-known values.
    fn (a, b: []let u8) -> bool
