the compiler defines a built in "module" called `intrinsics`.
it mainly contains constants that the compiler fills out with information
about itself or the module being compiled.

intrinsics::arch        the target architecture.
    aphelion = 0

intrinsics::system      the target OS or environment.
    freestanding = 0

intrinsics::product     the type of file created by the compiler.
    assembly = 0,

intrinsics::assert      like C's static_assert, compile-time-checks an expression for truth (must be a bool).
