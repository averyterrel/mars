the compiler defines a built in "module" called `intrinsics`.
it mainly contains constants that the compiler fills out with information
about itself or the module being compiled.

// instrinsics::arch - the target architecture.
let arch : enum int {
    aphelion = 0,
    /* more to come! */
} = (...);

// instrinsics::system - the target OS or environment.
let system : enum int {
    freestanding = 0,d
    /* more to come! */
} = (...);

// instrinsics::product - the type of file made by the compiler.
let product : enum int {
    assembly = 0,
    /* more to come! */
} = (...);
