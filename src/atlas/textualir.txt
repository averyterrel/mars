types are declared like so:

    type (identifer) = (type-expr)

a type expression is one of:

    bool
    u8
    u16
    u32
    u64
    i8
    i16
    i32
    i64
    f16
    f32
    f64
    (struct-type)
    (array-type)
    (pointer-type)
    (identifer)

a struct-type is an aggregate type defined as:

    {(type-expr)}
    {(type-expr), (type-expr), ...}

an array-type is an array type defined as:

    [(uint)](type-expr)

a pointer-type is a pointer type defined as:

    ^(type-expr)

type t1 = {i64, bool, bool}
type t2 = [3]i64
type t3 = ^i64
type t4 = ^t3
