SIL - shitty intermediate language

this is just to get codegen working until we can work on a better IR

let x: i64 = 3;
if x > 10 {
    x = 1;
} else {
    x = 2;
}
let y = x;

becomes

set t1, 3
local_store t1, -8      // -8 is the stack offset of x
local_load t2, -8
br_greater t2, 10, BB_1
jump BB_2

BB_1:
local_store 1, -8
jump BB_3

BB_2:
local_store 2, -8
jump BB_3

BB_3:
local_load t3, -8
local_store t3, -16
