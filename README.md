# The Mars Programming Language

Mars is a statically-typed, procedural, language for kernel and embedded programming. 
Mars focuses on clarity and control, with emphasis on code configuration.

Mars is a work-in-progress and currently only being developed for the [Aphelion ISA](https://github.com/orbit-systems/aphelion). Backends to common processors and environments are not out of the question, but significant development of the language and the compiler must happen before then.
